Lexer for a subset of Haskell programming language.

Important to know:
 - reading line by line because no token can span multiple lines,
   the only tricky part is multiline comments, they must be handled by
   a simple DFA.

Limitations:
 - works with ASCII only
 - the layout feature is not implemented [1]

To build:
 - ```make all```
 - ```make test``` to run tests
