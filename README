Lexer for a subset of Haskell programming language.
Run ```make```, then ```./app``` and pass the name of the file with Haskell source code.
You will get the stream of token printed to stdout, which will contain the information
about the location of each token in the source code.

Also have a lot at the tests, they are in the ```./test``` dir
