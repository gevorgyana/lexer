Lexer for a subset of Haskell programming language.

Important to know:
 - reading line by line is okay because no token can span multiple lines,
   the only tricky part is multiline comments, they must be handled by
   a simple DFA.
 - using the maximal munch principle is okay and advised by the Haskell 2010 report.
   However, for demonstration purpose, the lexer panicks when it does not know
   what token to produce, so that you do not get comfortable with it! :)

Limitations:
 - works with ASCII only (unicode is tricky)
 - the layout feature is not implemented [1]

To build & test at the same time (this project is built as a library and it has no
entry point by itself):
- run ```cargo test```
